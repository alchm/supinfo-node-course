## Angular app instructions


Be careful, there is a package.json file in the app/ folder.

It could be useful if you want to download the dependencies to reinstall them.

BUT, don't forget to copy/paste the libraries from the app/node_modules/ folder into the app/public/ folder, so your Angular app could work.

You can see the needed libraries in the app.html file (in the script tags)
